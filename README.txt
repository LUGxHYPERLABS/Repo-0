Welcome to your Github repository for the third and final LUGxHYPERLABS collaboration!

You and your partners will be teaming up to work in a github repository to create a simple project.

Before you begin, you'll want to create a directory to store this branch on your local machine.

Either in your home directory (~ for Linux) or under your Documents (for Windows), type the command:

--'mkdir LUGxHYPERLABS' (or you can name it anything else that's convenient)

--'ls' for Linux or 'dir' on windows cmd or powershell to verify the folder now exists

--'cd LUGxHYPERLABS' to work within that folder in the command line

--On linux enter the command 'pwd' just so you know the file path to get back.

Now it's time to get started on whatever repo you've been tasked with. You'll go to the command line and type

'git clone https://github.com/LUGxHYPERLABS/Repo-#' (# should be a number 1-6, based on what I requested you work on)

This should have created a new folder with all the files from this repo, including this README.
